      <strong>A Glimpse into the History of Pasta üçù</strong>
      <p className="text-center sm:text-left">
        While pasta is often associated with Italian cuisine, its origins are much more diverse. Historical records
        suggest that pasta has been around for centuries, with varying versions appearing in ancient China, the Middle East,
        and Europe. However, it was not until the 12th century that pasta as we know it today started to take shape in Italy.
        <br />
        The ancient Romans had a dish called <i>lagane</i>, which is quite similar to lasagna, and by the 13th century, Italian
        pasta makers were perfecting techniques for making and drying pasta, allowing it to be stored and transported across the globe.
        Pasta quickly became a staple in Italian households, with each region developing its own unique shape and sauce to match.
